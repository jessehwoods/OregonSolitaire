# OregonSolitaire
This is a program for playing the game Oregon, a solitaire card game designed by Reiner Knizia. The rules are available in his book "Blazing Aces!: A Fistful of Family Card Games". You can find this book on Amazon at the following URL:

In the interest of not violating Dr. Knizia's copyrights, I'm not going to copy the rules from there. It is a game about playing cards to form poker combinations, which is farily unusual among solitaire card games with the anglo-french deck, which tend to be about playing out all the cards instead of going for a score.
