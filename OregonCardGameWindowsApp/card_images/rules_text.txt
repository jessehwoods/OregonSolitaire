Oregon is a solitaire card game in which you try to make the best poker hands possible.


HOW TO PLAY
You will have a layout of up to five cards and a card in hand. You can choose to play your card in hand on top of another card in your layout, add a new card to your layout (if there's less than five) or use it as the first card in a new layout. If your layout contains a poker hand, it will be worth the amount listed below. If you start a new layout, you add the layout score to your total, but if you change the layout you will be stuck with the new score.


The game ends when the deck runs out of cards, and you get a final score to show you how well you did.


HAND VALUES


The layout is scored according to the following table. If you don't remember the poker hands, or never learned them, here's a quick refresher.


Straight Flush (Five cards in sequence, with the same suit) = 10
Four of a Kind (Four cards of the same rank) = 7
Full House (A pair and three of a kind) = 5
Flush (Five cards of the same suit) = 3
Straight (Five cards with sequential ranks) = 3
Three of a Kind (Three cards with the same rank) = 3
Two Pair (A pair of one rank and a pair of another rank) = 2
One Pair (Two cards of the same rank) = 1
PluggedNickel (A hand that doesn't fit anywhere else) = 0
